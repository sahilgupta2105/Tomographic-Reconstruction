# TDLAS Tomography Reconstruction Problem for tracking concentration of Carbon Dioxide

This program implements a GUI platform based on Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS). The GUI platform contains two concentration profiles for simulation: Cos-Gauss and Top-Hat. The program first generates data, which can be considered as readings from lasers. This data is then used as test case to solve the inverse problem of tomographic reconstruction. The solver here implements Modified Adaptive Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (paper is attached in the repository). Finally, the GUI displays the error and the reconstructed conc. profile. The user can change parameters to simulate gases other than CO2 as well.
